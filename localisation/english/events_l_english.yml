 commonwealth.1.t:0 "Beginning the 1936 Census"
 commonwealth.1.d:0 "Every 10 years or so, the Commonwealth holds a national census to determine both the populations and distributions of each of the peoples of our empire. This is important information for various reasons, but mainly to determine how our process of polonisation is progressing. With all of this in mind, it is time to begin the 1936 Commonwealth Census."

 commonwealth.2.t:0 "The Status of the Lithuanians"
 commonwealth.2.d:0 "The Lithuanians have long been our main partner in the Commonwealth having joined with us all the way back in 1569. Demographics have since shifted significantly and with the liberalisation of our empire, the Lithuanian areas of the Commonwealth now only stretch from Vilnius to Klaipėda. With our polonisation of Vilnius progressing recently, the Lithuanians are even close to losing their majority there too."

 commonwealth.2.b:0 "It's Rightfully Polish"
 commonwealth.3.t:0 "The Status of the Ruthenians"
 commonwealth.3.d:0 "Ruthenia has long been an area ruled by the Poles and Lithuanians. With our liberalisation, the Ruthenians now hold their own autonomous states, but that is slowly changing as we settle more Poles in the east. Should we continue with polonisation in the east however, unrest will continue to rise as it has been. The Ruthenians are the most agitated of our peoples as we displace many of them to the east as a part of polonisation."

 commonwealth.4.t:0 "The Status of the Jewish"
 commonwealth.4.d:0 "The Commonwealth is the home of most of the world's Jewish population thanks to our early adoption of religous freedoms. Most of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the empire. Although, our Southeast area has notably large amounts of Jews. While not exactly a problem, most of the Jewish population staunchy refuses to fully integrate into the empire."

 commonwealth.5.t:0 "The Status of the Germans"
 commonwealth.5.d:0 "The region referred to as Prussia has long been a part of the Commonwealth and has for that entire time had a significant German population. With the establishment of Nordtyksland to our West, Germans have flooded across our border completely ruining our efforts of polonisation in the region. Even so, the process will continue in Prussia as we already have large Polish minorities throughout the region."

 commonwealth.6.b:0 "Their Time Will Come"
 commonwealth.7.t:0 "Convening the Senate"
 commonwealth.7.d:0 "With the conclusion of the 1936 Census, it is time to decide how we should procede into the future. We must choose to either abandon polonisation in favor of a nation of equal peoples, or we must press on the gas and accelerate polonisation to be as efficient as possible. This decision will make or break the Commonwealth as we head into the future, and it is important that we don't make the wrong decision."

 commonwealth.8.d:0 "Unrest had been on the rise in the Commonwealth since the senate decided that full polonisation was the only way foward. In our failure to polonise areas fast enough, the status quo has finally been shattered and a general revolt has begun. Ukraine and Belorussia have already declared their independence and along with Russians, have seized what they're calling 'security zones' with a 'promise' to return them once we stabilize. Unfortunately, they know as well as us that the utter collapse of the Commonwealth is imminent, and all we can do now is brace for the impact."

Nevertheless, this is not a time to give up, nor is it a time to sit back and watch this disaster unfold, now is the time for action. While we may no longer be in the position of power we were once in, we are still a power nonetheless and have to continue marching on."

The Commonwealth's government failed to supress these revolts and they escalated into full-scale revolutions. With the utter collapse of the Commonwealth's government, new states had an easy time breaking away from the country with only a Polish rump state being left behind."

 commonwealth.16.d:0 "King Friedrich sat in comtemplation in his office. He slowly went from paper to paper reading the resignations over, although he wasn't really paying attention to the actual words written. The sound of a chirping bird outside and the tick of the clock on the wall were the only things that broke the deafening silence in the King's office. Was the bill failing truly the path the nation wanted to travel down? Well, it didn't matter what he thought anyway. The bill had failed to pass, numerous generals and statesmen had resigned, and the nation was crippled. Friedrich stopped reading the letters for a moment. He had made his decision. He set his pen down and left his office, motivated to turn this disaster around."
 commonwealth.16.a:0 "Time to get to work."
 commonwealth.17.t:0 "March of the Weary"
 commonwealth.17.d:0 "The Ruthenian officer looked on as the soldiers under his command marched defeated from the anarchist territories. Most of his soldiers were fellow Ruthenians and other minorities. His heart ached as he knew these soldiers were not only marching from defeat, but from their homes as well. If they were to ever retake the lost territory, the soldiers wouldn't be marching home, their home was gone forever. The anarchists would mangle the beauty of ruthenia into a degenerate pile of rubble. While the general blamed himself the most for their loss, he couldn't help but resent his commander who had resigned over the failure of the bill. They had lost everything they cared about, and for what...?"
 commonwealth.17.a:0 "Perhaps the anarchists had the right idea..."
 commonwealth.18.t:0 "Filling the Gaps"
 commonwealth.18.d:0 "Friedrich summoned the Sejm for another legislative session. Unsurprisingly, not a single one of the National Democracy deputies showed up for the session. Fortunately, with the Left Coalition majority, passing legislature should not be an issue. The King has compiled a list of bills to pass that he believes will mend the wounds caused by the recent crisis. Now it's up to the Sejm to move these bills into action."

 bur.3.t:0 "The Heart of Europe"
 bur.3.d:0 "Burgundy has stood as the industrial heart of europe for nearly a century uncontested. While not always the strongest nation in europe, it has certainly been the most productive during its existence. With the recent acquisition of the Ruhr region and parts of industrial France, Burgundy has once again peaked in productivity with its exports overtaking every other nation in the world."
 bur.3.a:0 "A True Golden Age"
 bur.4.t:0 "Foundations of Sand"
 bur.4.d:0 "Although, not everything in Burgundy is as well as it seems on the surface. Burgundy is a nation built in a region not traditionally known for good relations. The nation directly overlaps Dutch, German, and French areas with about an even split in respective populations with a small minority that considers themselves Burgundian. This situation has been an issue in the past as both France and the German regionals look upon our nation with eyes of bloodlust and hunger. In addition, several recent regionalist movements have seen growing unrest and rising nationalism in our population."
 bur.4.a:0 "Will the Glue Hold?"
 bur.5.t:0 "A Castle of Cards"
 bur.5.d:0 "Put simply, Burgundy is made of a false identity. There truly is no such thing as a 'Burgundian' people, but nevertheless we have worked tirelessly to make such into reality. The ultimate goal for a Burgundian culture is a fusion of Dutch, German, and French so that our people may live in harmony, although ask just about anyone and they'll tell you this is impossible. Even so, we have a natural duty to unite our people and ensure the nation survives forevermore even if just to serve our peoples."
 bur.5.a:0 "A Noble Initiative"
 #bur.6.t:0 "Wildfire!"
 #bur.6.d:0 "The French government has very recently been overthrown by the fires of revolution. On top of the already poor fact that this happened to one of our neighboring countries, sparks have already begun falling upon our tinderbox of a nation. If we do not act fast, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that our nation will collapse."
 #bur.6.a:0 "Phone the Firefighters!"
 bur.7.t:0 "Containment Theory"
 bur.7.d:0 "After a meeting concerning Burgundy's reaction to the recent French revolution, a new policy idea has come to light. Our foreign advisor calls it 'containment theory'. The theory is that in order to stop a domino effect of revolutions throughout Europe, the revolution must be contained by an alliance of anti-revolutionary nations on all sides. This means we will need the cooperation of the nations surrounding France in order to effectively contain the cancer that is the revolution."
 bur.7.a:0 "Let's End the Revolution Before it Begins."
 bur.8.t:0 "A Meeting With the English"
 bur.8.d:0 "While Burgundy has been recent historical enemies with the English, some things must be set aside in order to strive for the greater good. We must put our animosity towards the English aside in order to effectively stop the French revolution from spreading."
 bur.8.a:0 "Invite the English to the Pact"
 bur.9.t:0 "A Request From Burgundy"
 bur.9.d:0 "The ignorant Burgundians have sent a diplomat to London to discuss a sort of alliance with their nation. In attempts to overlook the recent destruction of Britain no thanks to them, they are asking we join their anti-revolutionary pact against France. While the revolutionaries are certainly enemies to the English, allying with Burgundy also seems like a ridiculous solution. Perhaps some sort of compromise could be reached?"
 bur.9.a:0 "Send Subpar Financial Support."
 bur.10.t:0 "The English Response"
 bur.10.d:0 "England has responded to our request of an alliance with... a small amount of financial aid. Citing the vast spending and politicing that goes into their ongoing hostilities with the Celtic Union, England has declined a full alliance against the revolutionaries and has instead opted for token support. This is likely because of the recent hostilities between our nations, but perhaps even their small donation may help..."
 bur.10.a:0 "Look on the Bright Side..?"
 bur.11.t:0 "Petition the Spanish"
 bur.11.d:0 "The Spanish are the other notable power right near the French besides ourselves and the English. While the English may not have joined our pact, the Spanish would also work to strengthen the anti-revolutionary cause. Despite their neutrality in the world war, Spain has been a close friend to Burgundy for ages, and we shall ensure that bond doesn't end now or ever."
 bur.11.a:0 "Let's Ask Our Old Friends for Assistance"
 bur.12.t:0 "A Humble Request"
 bur.12.d:0 "Our old friends in Burgundy have recently made a particular request to us concerning the revolution in France. They are seeking to stitch a network of alliances to stop the spread of the revolution. While it is certainly a noble initiative, we are not in a position to fight a nation such as France, even after their revolution. The least we can do though is promise expeditionary forces."
 bur.12.a:0 "Good Luck, Old Friend."
 bur.13.t:0 "A Lukewarm Reception"
 bur.13.d:0 "Spain certainly understands our distress and wishes to help more. Unfortunately they are not convinced that they can seriously help againt the revolutionary menace. However, they have offered to send an expeditionary force against the revolutionaries should the situation ever boil over. While it is certainly not the response we wanted, it's more support than the English offered."
 bur.13.a:0 "It Could be Worse..."
 bur.14.t:0 "Ensuring French Embargo"
 bur.14.d:0 "Our representative of the International Genoese Council has proposed in a passive agressive manner that Genoa should cease all trade with France at once. If the Genoan executives have any sense, they'll follow the demand, and in the case that they don't, there will be consequences. Whether the other representatives agree with this demand remains to be seen, but most of the represented nations seem to hold at least some animosity towards the revolutionaries."
 bur.14.a:0 "An Easy Deal."
 bur.15.t:0 "Covert Operations"
 bur.15.d:0 "Catalonia, a region of Aragon, has seen a massive increase in support for independence following the French revolution. With their nationalist movement having already been a constant threat to Aragon, the revolution has only bolstered that movement and strengthened its power. Aragonese control over Catalonia may be on the verge of collapse at this point, no thanks to the likely presence of French operatives. In order to help Aragon maintain control, we shall send some of our own operatives to help counter the nationalists."
 bur.15.a:0 "The French Must be Stopped."
 bur.16.t:0 "Public Backlash"
 bur.16.d:0 "Our recent operation to counter the Catalonian nationalists in Aragon has drastically backfired. Not only did the French find out about our operations days after we began, but the Aragonese also found out and have publically denounced us for interfering with their domestic affairs... Almost no one has taken our side in this case and our failure has certainly lowered our reputation..."
 bur.16.a:0 "What a Disaster!"
 bur.17.t:0 "A Meeting With the Swiss"
 bur.17.d:0 "One of our diplomats recently met with the Swiss over the course of a week to negotiate over anti-revolutionary matters. The goal of these meetings was simple; we requested that Switzerland cease trading with both France and Bavaria and in exchange, we would make deals quite heavily in their favor. Unfortunately, the Swiss have declined our offer on the basis that Burgundian fear over the new left-wing nations lacks a foundation. While it may seem to be a polite reply, the Swiss have done the national equivalent of spitting in our face. While this is an unforuante outcome, we need to continue our efforts, no matter the cost."
 bur.17.a:0 "And to Think Our Nations Were Alike."
 bur.18.t:0 "Promises to the Basque"
 bur.18.d:0 "While certainly not a powerful nation, the Basque Republic is nonetheless a neighbor of the French and as such we have a duty to ensure their protection against the revolutionaries. We may have ignored their existence in the past, but now is no time for the burdens of our past. Should the Basque Republic support our efforts to return order to France, we shall offer to ensure the French Basque area gains its autonomy."
 bur.18.a:0 "Surely Such an Offer Should Tempt Them!"
 bur.19.t:0 "A Deal From Burgundy"
 bur.19.d:0 "Burgundy has offered us an interesting deal. They are interested in our support of what they call the 'anti-revolutionary pact', and in an attempt to lure us onto their side, they are offering the French Basque region autonomy should the revolutionary government in France be deposed. While it may certainly sound like a nice offer, the revolutionaries have truthfully been more kind to the French Basque than any French government in the past. Betraying that trust may do more harm to our people than good."
 bur.19.a:0 "Politely Decline the Offer."
 bur.20.t:0 "The Basque Republic Declines"
 bur.20.d:0 "Without a formal explanation, the Basque Republic has declined our generous offer. Surely they must already be under the influence of the revolutionaries to so ignorantly decline, and assuming they are, having them in our pact would do more harm than good anyway. Perhaps, it was in our best interest that they declined."
 bur.20.a:0 "Mental Gymnastics..."
 bur.21.t:0 "French Regions Protest!"
 bur.21.d:0 "Our recent anti-French rhetoric has not pleased our French population. Despite the propaganda being aimed towards the revolutionaries, our French citizens have taken it as a slight towards themselves as well and have begun mass protests against our government demanding we resign. While that certainly won't happen, we need to make amends with our citizens as soon as possible to ensure they don't become radicalized."
 bur.21.a:0 "Another Mess to Clean Up..."
 bur.22.t:0 "Dousing the Flames"
 bur.22.d:0 "While external threats loom both to our south and our east, domestic affairs are just as important in our response to the French revolution. Our multiethnic nation has become more divided than ever as a result of revolutionary agitation on top of our already existing divisions. While France burns to our south, we must make sure our nation is not engulfed in flames as well. We may be a bit behind schedule as numerous protest and riots have begun, but we must still try."
 bur.22.a:0 "For Burgundy's Sake!"
 bur.23.t:0 "Crushing the Nationalists"
 bur.23.d:0 "While we have certainly had our fair share of nationalist movements in the past, none compare to the chaos throughout the nation at the present. Germans and French more than anything have begun mass protests and riots against our rule calling us tyrants and dictators. Measures must be taken to stop these activites before the moderates of our nation begin siding with the radical elements."
 bur.23.a:0 "We Should've Seen it Coming..."
 bur.24.t:0 "Burgundian Nationalism Backfires"
 bur.24.d:0 "In an ironic twist of fate, the radical elements in our nation have mangled our idea of 'Unity in Division' to their whims. They are tearing our message apart and have said that we recognize the divisions in our nation and claim we are doing nothing about it. Not only are the radical elements demanding the government resign, but they are demanding german independence and french independence."
 bur.24.a:0 "It Couldn't Possibly Get Worse... Right?"
 bur.25.t:0 "The Ruhr Riots Spread"
 bur.25.d:0 "Our suppression of the Ruhr Riots has only seen the situation get worse. The riots have spread to the entire Rheinish area with a complete shutdown of all our industry in the area and near anarchy in the region. Bavaria has taken the opportunity to denounce our nation for our horrible treatment of our german population. We must craft a careful response so that it may not get worse."
 bur.25.a:0 "..."
 bur.26.t:0 "Supporting German Regionalism"
 bur.26.d:0 "One of the main tenants of the German revolutionaries is a united German nation. This rhetoric has done some bad damage to our german population as a separatist movement to join Bavaria has gained traction. The most we can do to counter this semi-peacefully is to promote german regionalism, after all not all germans are the same anyway. How could Burgundian germans and south germans ever live together?"
 bur.26.a:0 "Surely They Will See Reason."
 bur.27.t:0 "Wildfire!"
 bur.27.d:0 "The French government has very recently been overthrown by the fires of revolution. On top of the already poor fact that this happened to one of our neighboring countries, sparks have already begun falling upon our tinderbox of a nation. If we do not act fast, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that our nation will collapse."
