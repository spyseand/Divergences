 dual_monarchy.1.t:0 "The War of Liberation"
 dual_monarchy.1.d:0 "The battle for Ameriga and Arcadia has begun. The nations of the west recognize the blood that will be spilled, yet they must fight. Not just for their country, but their very ideals, beliefs, and dreams. This is nothing like any war they've seen before, and will likely be the first and last of its kind."
 dual_monarchy.1.a:0 "To Victory!"
 commonwealth.1.t:0 "Beginning the 1936 Census"
 commonwealth.1.d:0 "Every 10 years or so, the Commonwealth holds a national census to determine both the populations and distributions of each of the peoples of our empire. This is important information for various reasons, but mainly to determine how our process of polonisation is progressing. With all of this in mind, it is time to begin the 1936 Commonwealth Census."
 commonwealth.1.a:0 "Start the Counting"

 commonwealth.2.t:0 "The Status of the Lithuanians"
 commonwealth.2.d:0 "The Lithuanians have long been our main partner in the Commonwealth having joined with us all the way back in 1569. Demographics have since shifted significantly and with the liberalisation of our empire, the Lithuanian areas of the Commonwealth now only stretch from Vilnius to Klaipėda. With our polonisation of Vilnius progressing recently, the Lithuanians are even close to losing their majority there too."
 commonwealth.2.a:0 "Perhaps That's too Far"
 commonwealth.2.b:0 "It's Rightfully Polish"
 commonwealth.3.t:0 "The Status of the Ruthenians"
 commonwealth.3.d:0 "Ruthenia has long been an area ruled by the Poles and Lithuanians. With our liberalisation, the Ruthenians now hold their own autonomous states, but that is slowly changing as we settle more Poles in the east. Should we continue with polonisation in the east however, unrest will continue to rise as it has been. The Ruthenians are the most agitated of our peoples as we displace many of them to the east as a part of polonisation."
 commonwealth.3.a:0 "Maybe we Should Stop..."
 commonwealth.3.b:0 "We Will Continue as we Have"
 commonwealth.4.t:0 "The Status of the Jewish"
 commonwealth.4.d:0 "The Commonwealth is the home of most of the world's Jewish population thanks to our early adoption of religous freedoms. Most of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the empire. Although, our Southeast area has notably large amounts of Jews. While not exactly a problem, most of the Jewish population staunchy refuses to fully integrate into the empire."
 commonwealth.4.a:0 "As Long as They're Loyal"
 commonwealth.4.b:0 "Integration is a Must!"
 commonwealth.5.t:0 "The Status of the Germans"
 commonwealth.5.d:0 "The region referred to as Prussia has long been a part of the Commonwealth and has for that entire time had a significant German population. With the establishment of Nordtyksland to our West, Germans have flooded across our border completely ruining our efforts of polonisation in the region. Even so, the process will continue in Prussia as we already have large Polish minorities throughout the region."
 commonwealth.5.a:0 "A New Home for the Germans"
 commonwealth.5.b:0 "An Annoying Hinderance"
 commonwealth.6.t:0 "The Status of the Livonians"
 commonwealth.6.d:0 "The Livonians are one of the few peoples in our empire that are not actively being polonised. With their land being north of Lithuania, our Polish lands have no direct connection and we have more adjacent territory to polonise."
 commonwealth.6.a:0 "All People Should be Free Like Them"
 commonwealth.6.b:0 "Their Time Will Come"
 commonwealth.7.t:0 "Convening the Senate"
 commonwealth.7.d:0 "With the conclusion of the 1936 Census, it is time to decide how we should procede into the future. We must choose to either abandon polonisation in favor of a nation of equal peoples, or we must press on the gas and accelerate polonisation to be as efficient as possible. This decision will make or break the Commonwealth as we head into the future, and it is important that we don't make the wrong decision."
 commonwealth.7.a:0 "Polonisation was a Mistake, the Commonwealth Shall be a Nation of Equals"
 commonwealth.7.b:0 "Polonisation is the Only Way Foward. Step on the Gas!"
 commonwealth.8.t:0 "The Collapse of the Commonwealth"
 commonwealth.8.d:0 "Unrest had been on the rise in the Commonwealth since the senate decided that full polonisation was the only way foward. In our failure to polonise areas fast enough, the status quo has finally been shattered and a general revolt has begun. Ukraine and Belorussia have already declared their independence and along with Russians, have seized what they're calling 'security zones' with a 'promise' to return them once we stabilize. Unfortunately, they know as well as us that the utter collapse of the Commonwealth is imminent, and all we can do now is brace for the impact."

 commonwealth.9.t:0 "The Final Bell Tolls"
 commonwealth.9.d:0 "Lithuanian, Prussia, and Livonia have unilaterally declared independence from our failing nation. The Commonwealth is effectively dead. Our failures will weigh down the backs of every Pole in our nation in the coming decades as we are surronded by our failure to realize our dream of a greater Polish state. Nevertheless, this is not a time to give up, nor is it a time to sit back and watch this disaster unfold, now is the time for action. While we may no longer be in the position of power we were once in, we are still a power nonetheless and have to continue marching on."

 commonwealth.10.t:0 "The Jewish Regions Revolt"
 commonwealth.10.d:0 "Presumably as a result of our increasingly nationalist rhetoric, the jewish regions of our southeast have opted to break away from our nation. While we are powerless to stop them for the time being, we will reconquer them soon enough."
 commonwealth.10.a:0 "Damn it all!"
 commonwealth.10.b:0 "A Nation of Our Own! §C(Switches to Ashkenazi State)§!"
 commonwealth.11.t:0 "The Anarchists Revolt!"
 commonwealth.11.d:0 "Thanks to the collapse of the Commonwealth, our government has become incredibly unstable and the anarchists have seized the opportunity to declare a massive amount of our country as a 'Free Territory'. Crimea has also opted to break away and instead find closer ties with the Ottomans across the Black Sea."
 commonwealth.11.a:0 "They Will Not Get Away With This!"
 commonwealth.11.b:0 "Long Live Anarchy! §C(Switches to the Free Territories)§!"
 commonwealth.11.c:0 "Our Present Secured. §C(Switches to Crimea)§!"
 commonwealth.12.t:0 "The Collapse of the Commonwealth"
 commonwealth.12.d:0 "After a long period of unrest amoung the peoples of the Commonwealth, the breaking point was finally reached when the Commonwealth's senate decided to go full speed ahead with polonisation. The Commonwealth's government failed to supress these revolts and they escalated into full-scale revolutions. With the utter collapse of the Commonwealth's government, new states had an easy time breaking away from the country with only a Polish rump state being left behind."
 commonwealth.12.a:0 "That's Not Good..."
 earlysetup.5.t:0 "Burgundy Paritioned!"
 earlysetup.5.d:0 "To the surprise of all of the major european nations, France and Bavaria have paritioned Burgundy. Despite no pretense, France sent the demand to Burgundy demanding they hand over their French and German territories. The balance of power in Europe has been disturbed, and the powers of old wait with bated breath to see what these revolutionaries will do next."
 earlysetup.5.a:0 "Alarming."
 fra.2.t:0 "The Congo Rebellion"

 ottoman.1.t:0 "Hegemons of the Mid-east"
 ottoman.1.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire has stood strong for nearly five hundred years. With the exception of slight losses, such as full control over Egypt, we have been the uncontested hegemons over the middle east for the majority of our existence. Recently, unrest has been rising once more throughtout our vilayets, but that shall be no matter. It hasn't ever been before, and we shall ensure that it will not be an issue this time, nor ever in the future."
