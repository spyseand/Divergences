 dual_monarchy.1.t:0 "The War of Liberation"
 dual_monarchy.1.d:0 "The battle for Ameriga and Arcadia has begun. The nations of the west recognize the blood that will be spilled, yet they must fight. Not just for their country, but their very ideals, beliefs, and dreams. This is nothing like any war they've seen before, and will likely be the first and last of its kind."
 dual_monarchy.1.a:0 "To Victory!"
 commonwealth.1.t:0 "Beginning the 1936 Census"
 commonwealth.1.d:0 "Every 10 years or so, the Commonwealth holds a national census to determine both the populations and distributions of each of the peoples of our empire. This is important information for various reasons, but mainly to determine how our process of polonisation is progressing. With all of this in mind, it is time to begin the 1936 Commonwealth Census."
 commonwealth.1.a:0 "Start the Counting"

 commonwealth.2.t:0 "The Status of the Lithuanians"
 commonwealth.2.d:0 "The Lithuanians have long been our main partner in the Commonwealth having joined with us all the way back in 1569. Demographics have since shifted significantly and with the liberalisation of our empire, the Lithuanian areas of the Commonwealth now only stretch from Vilnius to Klaipėda. With our polonisation of Vilnius progressing recently, the Lithuanians are even close to losing their majority there too."
 commonwealth.2.a:0 "Perhaps That's too Far"
 commonwealth.2.b:0 "It's Rightfully Polish"
 commonwealth.3.t:0 "The Status of the Ruthenians"
 commonwealth.3.d:0 "Ruthenia has long been an area ruled by the Poles and Lithuanians. With our liberalisation, the Ruthenians now hold their own autonomous states, but that is slowly changing as we settle more Poles in the east. Should we continue with polonisation in the east however, unrest will continue to rise as it has been. The Ruthenians are the most agitated of our peoples as we displace many of them to the east as a part of polonisation."
 commonwealth.3.a:0 "Maybe we Should Stop..."
 commonwealth.3.b:0 "We Will Continue as we Have"
 commonwealth.4.t:0 "The Status of the Jewish"
 commonwealth.4.d:0 "The Commonwealth is the home of most of the world's Jewish population thanks to our early adoption of religous freedoms. Most of the Jewish population is dispersed throughout the empire. Although, our Southeast area has notably large amounts of Jews. While not exactly a problem, most of the Jewish population staunchy refuses to fully integrate into the empire."
 commonwealth.4.a:0 "As Long as They're Loyal"
 commonwealth.4.b:0 "Integration is a Must!"
 commonwealth.5.t:0 "The Status of the Germans"
 commonwealth.5.d:0 "The region referred to as Prussia has long been a part of the Commonwealth and has for that entire time had a significant German population. With the establishment of Nordtyksland to our West, Germans have flooded across our border completely ruining our efforts of polonisation in the region. Even so, the process will continue in Prussia as we already have large Polish minorities throughout the region."
 commonwealth.5.a:0 "A New Home for the Germans"
 commonwealth.5.b:0 "An Annoying Hinderance"
 commonwealth.6.t:0 "The Status of the Livonians"
 commonwealth.6.d:0 "The Livonians are one of the few peoples in our empire that are not actively being polonised. With their land being north of Lithuania, our Polish lands have no direct connection and we have more adjacent territory to polonise."
 commonwealth.6.a:0 "All People Should be Free Like Them"
 commonwealth.6.b:0 "Their Time Will Come"
 commonwealth.7.t:0 "Convening the Senate"
 commonwealth.7.d:0 "With the conclusion of the 1936 Census, it is time to decide how we should procede into the future. We must choose to either abandon polonisation in favor of a nation of equal peoples, or we must press on the gas and accelerate polonisation to be as efficient as possible. This decision will make or break the Commonwealth as we head into the future, and it is important that we don't make the wrong decision."
 commonwealth.7.a:0 "Polonisation was a Mistake, the Commonwealth Shall be a Nation of Equals"
 commonwealth.7.b:0 "Polonisation is the Only Way Foward. Step on the Gas!"
